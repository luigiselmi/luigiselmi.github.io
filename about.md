I work as a scientific software engineer at my own company [datiaperti](https://www.datiaperti.it) based in Rome, Italy. Before taking the leap from being an employee to being self-employed, I worked as a software engineer in many public and private organizations in Italy, Switzerland and Germany. In Germany I worked at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in EU and German funded research projects and industry projects related to Semantic Web, Machine Learning and Big Data technologies. In Switzerland, I worked as a research associate and software engineer in two FP7 research projects about data integration using Semantic Web technologies at the E-Government Institute of the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/en/). Before moving abroad I worked in Italy as a consultant in software development projects at various multinational companies such as Ericsson, Marconi Communications, Accenture, and Italian government institutions. I hold an M.Sc. in Physics from the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/fisica/en) with a thesis on Atmospheric Physics and Laser Radar Remote Sensing under the supervision of [Prof. Giorgio Fiocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Fiocco). I have co-authored papers on Semantic Web, E-Government and Remote Sensing. My main interests are artificial intelligence, algorithms, computer vision, earth observation and remote sensing, open source software development and open data.

## Work experience
#### Fraunhofer IAIS (2015-12-01 – 2019-11-30), Sankt Augustin (Germany)
I worked as project leader and software architect in EU and German research projects and industry projects based on Big Data, Semantic Technology and Machine Learning. As a software architect I designed the architecture of the Smart, Green and Integrated Transport pilot for the Big Data Europe H2020 project using open source frameworks such as Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Elasticsearch. I also acquired experience in using Docker containers for deployment. I led an industry project for a Spanish customer to implement and deploy the back-end of their online e-commerce platform and additional services based on Apache Solr and Apache Cassandra and machine learning algorithms for recommendations and price prediction. As a project leader I applied agile methodologies in both research and industry projects for project planning and management, cost estimation, development and continuous integration using the full set of tools provided by Atlassian.

#### E-Government Institute of the Bern University of Applied Sciences (2012-09-01 - 2015-10-31), Bern (Switzerland)
I was involved in two European FP7 projects both led by the Bern University of Applied Sciences. In the first project, [Fusepool](https://github.com/fusepool), I developed Java OSGi components for the transformation of XML or tabular data into RDF and for the disambiguation and interlinking of entities. The second project [Fusepool P3](https://github.com/fusepoolP3) was aimed at providing components to implement workflows for Linked Data Platforms. I participated in the writing of the proposal and in the development of the software. Each platform components could communicate with others through a REST interface. My work was focused on interlinking, based on
the Silk framework and in the use of geographical data. I developed also a semantic web application to visualize geographical data from a Linked Data Platform and search points of interest in a map. In both projects I participated in the writing of deliverables and published papers as author or co-author in peer-reviewed journals.

#### University of Trento Dept. of Information Engineering and Computer Science (2011-03-01 - 2011-08-31)
I received a scholarship for a research study on data integration at the entity level through heterogeneous systems.

## Languages
Italian is my mother tongue. I speak English fluently as it's the language I use the most since 2010. I can understand quite a bit of German, French and Portuguese. I got a [Cambridge First Certificate English](assets/cv/cambridge_esol_certificate.jpg) (Level B2 of the EU Reference for Languages) in 2010, and a [telc Zertifikat Deutsch B1](assets/cv/telc_Deutsch_B1.jpg) in 2017.

## Other skills
I like being in the nature, most often in the Apennine Mountains in Central Italy, not far from Rome. I have a 1° degree FIPSAS/CMAS [diver](https://www.flickr.com/photos/susterru/7939836234) license and I have been practicing [mountain climbing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/susterru/293369805) and [skiing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/susterru/2149914032).
