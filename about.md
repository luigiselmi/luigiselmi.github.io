I am a project leader and senior software engineer in the Enterprise Information Systems department at Fraunhofer IAIS where I have been working in EU funded research projects and industry projects related to Semantic Web, Machine Learning and Big Data technologies. Prior to joining Fraunhofer IAIS in 2015, I have worked as a research associate and software engineer at the E-Government Institute of the Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland (2012 - 2015) in two FP7 research projects about data integration using Semantic Web technologies. In Italy I have worked  as a consultant with various multinational companies such as Ericsson, Marconi Communications, Accenture, and Italian government institutions. I hold an M.Sc. in Physics from the Sapienza University of Rome. I have (co)authored papers on Semantic Web, E-Government and Remote Sensing. I hold several certificates in computer programming, logic, semantic technologies, machine learning, deep learning and project management.
