I am a human (i.e. not a cyborg) currently working as a scientific software engineer at my own company [datiaperti](https://www.datiaperti.it). Before taking the leap from being an employee to being self-employed, I worked as a software engineer in many public and private organizations in Italy, Switzerland and Germany. In Germany I worked at Fraunhofer IAIS in EU funded research projects and industry projects related to Semantic Web, Machine Learning and Big Data technologies. Prior to joining Fraunhofer IAIS, I worked as a research associate and software engineer at the E-Government Institute of the Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland in two FP7 research projects about data integration using Semantic Web technologies. In Italy I have worked as a consultant with various multinational companies such as Ericsson, Marconi Communications, Accenture, and Italian government institutions. I hold an M.Sc. in Physics from the Sapienza University of Rome with a specialization in Atmospheric Physics and Remote Sensing. I have (co)authored papers on Semantic Web, E-Government and Remote Sensing.
