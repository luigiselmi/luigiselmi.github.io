I work as a scientific software engineer at my own company [datiaperti](https://www.datiaperti.it) based in Rome, Italy. Before taking the leap from being an employee to being self-employed, I worked as a software engineer in many public and private organizations in Italy, Switzerland and Germany. In Germany I worked at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems](https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in EU and German funded research projects and industry projects related to Semantic Web, Machine Learning and Big Data technologies. In Switzerland, I worked as a research associate and software engineer in two FP7 research projects about data integration using Semantic Web technologies at the E-Government Institute of the [Bern University of Applied Sciences](https://www.bfh.ch/en/). Before moving abroad I have worked in Italy as a consultant in software development projects at various multinational companies such as Ericsson, Marconi Communications, Accenture, and Italian government institutions. I hold an M.Sc. in Physics from the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/fisica/en) with a thesis on Atmospheric Physics and Laser Radar Remote Sensing under the supervision of [Prof. Giorgio Fiocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Fiocco). I have (co)authored papers on Semantic Web, E-Government and Remote Sensing. My main interests are computational physics, artificial intelligence, algorithms, computer vision, open source software development and open data.

## Work experience
#### Fraunhofer IAIS (2015-12-01 – 2019-11-30), Sankt Augustin (Germany)
I have been working as project leader and software architect in EU and German research projects and industry projects based on Big Data, Semantic Technology and Machine Learning. As a software architect I have designed the architecture of the Smart, Green and Integrated Transport pilot for the Big Data Europe H2020 project using open source frameworks such as Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Elasticsearch. I have also
acquired experience in using Docker containers for deployment. I have led an industry project for a Spanish customer to implement and deploy the back-end of their online e-commerce platform and additional services based on Apache Solr and Apache Cassandra and machine learning algorithms for recommendations and price prediction. As a project leader I have applied agile methodologies in both research and industry projects for
project planning and management, cost estimation, development and continuous integration using the full set of tools provided by Atlassian.

#### E-Government Institute of the Bern University of Applied Sciences (2012-09-01 - 2015-10-31), Bern (Switzerland)
I have been involved in two European FP7 projects both led by the Bern University of Applied Sciences. In the first project, [Fusepool](https://github.com/fusepool), I developed Java OSGi components for the transformation of XML or tabular data into RDF and for the disambiguation and interlinking of entities. The second project, [Fusepool P3](https://github.com/fusepoolP3) was aimed at providing components to implement workflows for Linked Data Platforms. I participated in the writing of the proposal and in the development of the software. Each platform components could communicate with others through a REST interface. My work has been focused on interlinking, based on
the Silk framework and in the use of geographical data. I developed also a semantic web application to visualize geographical data from a Linked Data Platform and search points of interest in a map. In both projects I participated in the writing of deliverables and published papers as author or co-author in peer-reviewed journals.

#### University of Trento Dept. of Information Engineering and Computer Science (2011-03-01 - 2011-08-31)
Scholarship for a research study on data integration at the entity level through heterogeneous systems.

## Languages
Italian is my mother tongue. I speak English fluently as it's the language I use the most since 2010. I can understand quite a bit of German, French and Portuguese. I got a Cambridge First Certificate English (Level B2 of the EU Reference for Languages) in 2010 and a telc Zertifikat Deutsch B1 in 2017.

## Other skills
I like being in the nature, most often in the Apennine Mountains in Central Italy, not far from Rome. I have a 1° degree FIPSAS/CMAS [diver](https://www.flickr.com/photos/susterru/7939836234) license and I have been practicing [mountain climbing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/susterru/293369805) and [skiing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/susterru/2149914032).
