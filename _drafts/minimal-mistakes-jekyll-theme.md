In a [previous post](https://www.luigiselmi.eu/how_to_build_your_jekyll_website.html) we have seen how to create a website scaffold with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), change some settings, add a page, an image, and write a post. We used the default theme *minima*. While it can be good enough for a personal website, we may want to create a site for our business, still simple but with more options for the layout of our pages and posts, a search index to filter our posts, and many other. In order to keep everything simple we will start from scratch creating a scaffold with Jekyll and modifying the content step by step.
