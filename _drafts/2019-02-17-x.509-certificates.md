Blog post on X.509 certificate (from CA-signed or self-signed)
About
1. how to create a chain of a root-ca and a sub-ca
2. create CA-signed certificates
3. create a self-signed certificate
4. Use a free CA authority: Let's Encrypt

Using a certificate is a good way to prevent “man-in-the-middle” attacks. (see Schneider about man-in-the-midde attack)

## Roles
* Certification Authority: is the issuer of a certificate. Certification authorities form a chain, from the root to the leaf. The path from the leaf can be traced back to the root from the certificate.
* Subject/subscriber: is the entity whose identity is certified by an authority
* Relying Party: is the agent, e.g. a browser, used by a subject to provide its identity to a remote server by its certificate. It keeps a set of root CA certificates.

## The X.509 Standard
A certificate contains a public key with additional information of a subject, a person or organization, and also information about the issuing certification authority. X.509 is one standard format of a certificate. It contains fields to provide the details of the subscriber and of the certification authority. The main fields, in X.509 version 3, are the following

* Signature algorithm
* Issuer
* Validity
* Subject (Alternative Name)
* Public key
* Name constraints
* Authority Information Access
* Subject Key Identifier
* Authority Key Identifier

## The Lifecycle
1. The subscriber (or the authority who will manage the root Certification Authority) creates a private key
2. The subscriber creates Certificate Signing Request (CSR). The CSR contains the public key of the subscriber, corresponding to the private one created before, with some additional information that will be part of the certificate. The CSR is also signed using the private key of the subscriber. During the creation of the CSR OpenSSL will ask questions such as the “Country Name” and the “Organization Name”. These two must match with the country name and organization name of the Certification Authority (?). The request can also be created using a request configuration file (see Bulletproof SSL, p.355).  
3. The subscriber sends the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to a Certification Authority (CA)
4. The CA validates the request, for example sending an email with a link to follow to the subscriber (domain validation)
5. If the validation is successful the CA issues the certificate.

## Root Certification Authority (CA) Generation
 TODO: discuss the difference between creating the key of the root CA from the command line or using a configuration file.
 The typical key for securing web sites uses the RSA cryptosystem with a key size of 2048 bits. The generation
 of a private key based on RSA is pretty straightforward with OpenSSL
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out fd.key 2048
{% endhighlight %}
The private key generated is in the PEM format. Its structure can be see using the command
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl rsa -text -in fd.key
{% endhighlight %}
The public key can be computed from the private one
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl rsa -in fd.key -pubout -out fd-public.key
{% endhighlight %}
Creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is more delicate since many information must be provided in the request and that will be in the certificate for the authority to issue a certificate. They are:
country, province and locality name, organization, unit, common name and email, optionally a company name.
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -new -key fd.key -out fd.csr
{% endhighlight %}
After the certificate signing request has been created it can be checked
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -text -in fd.csr -noout
{% endhighlight %}
1. Generate key and Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -new -config root-ca.conf -out root-ca.csr -keyout private/root-ca.k
{% endhighlight %}
PEM pass phrase: roma caput mundi

2. Create self-signed certificate
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ca -selfsign -config root-ca.conf -in root-ca.csr -out root-ca.crt -extensions ca_ext
{% endhighlight %}
Enter pass phrase: roma caput mundi

3. Generate a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ca -gencrl -config root-ca.conf -out root-ca.crl
{% endhighlight %}
Enter pass phrase for ./private/root-ca.key: roma caput mundi

## Root CA Operations

1. Issue a certificate for a sub certification authority
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ca -config root-ca.conf -in sub-ca.csr -out sub-ca.crt -extensions sub_ca_ext
{% endhighlight %}
2. Revoke a certificate of a sub certification authority
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ca -config root-ca.conf -revoke certs/1002.pem -crl_reason keyCompromise
{% endhighlight %}
## Create a certficate for Online Certificate Signing Protocol (OCSP) signing

1. Create key and CSR
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -subj "/C=GB/O=Example/CN=OCSP Root Responder" -keyout private/root-ocsp.key -out root-ocsp.csr
{% endhighlight %}
Enter PEM pass phrase: roma caput mundi

2. Issue a certificate
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ca -config root-ca.conf -in root-ocsp.csr -out root-ocsp.crt -extensions ocsp_ext -days 30
{% endhighlight %}
3. Start the OCSP responder
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ocsp -port 9080 -index db/index -rsigner root-ocsp.crt -rkey private/root-ocsp.key -CA root-ca.crt -text
{% endhighlight %}
4. Test the OCSP server from another shell
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ocsp -issuer root-ca.crt -CAfile root-ca.crt -cert root-ocsp.crt -url http://127.0.0.1:9080
{% endhighlight %}
## Creating a Subordinate CA

1. Prepare a configuration file for the subordinate CA using the root CA configuration file as a template

2. Subordinate CA generation: generate key and CSR
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -new -config sub-ca.conf -out sub-ca.csr -keyout private/sub-ca.key
{% endhighlight %}
3. Issue a certificate for the subordinate CA by the root CA
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ca -config root-ca.conf -in sub-ca.csr -out sub-ca.crt -extensions sub_ca_ext
{% endhighlight %}
## Subordinate CA Operations

1. Issue a server certificate (missing server.csr)
  a. Create a private key for the server
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private/server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
{% endhighlight %}

  b. Generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the server to be sent to the subauthority
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -new -key private/server.key -out server.csr
{% endhighlight %}
c) The subauthority signs a certificate for the server from the request
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ca -config sub-ca.conf -in server.csr -out server.crt -extensions server_ext
{% endhighlight %}
2) Issue a client certificate (missing client.csr)

a) Create a private key for the client
{% highlight bash %}
$ $ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private/client.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
{% endhighlight %}
b) Generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the client to be sent to the subauthority
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -new -key private/client.key -out client.csr
{% endhighlight %}
c) The subauthority signs a client certificate from the request
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl ca -config sub-ca.conf -in client.csr -out client.crt -extensions client_ext
{% endhighlight %}

## Signing Your Own Certificate

You might want to create a self-signed certificate without sending any request to a certification authority. For example a certificate
for the server
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key private/server.key -out server.crt
{% endhighlight %}
## Examining your certificate
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl x509 -text -in server.crt -noout
{% endhighlight %}
A self-signed certificate will have the property
 X509v3 Basic Constraints:
                CA:TRUE

meaning that it is a CA certificate and could be used to sign new certificates. Usually certificates issued by a CA have this property set
to FALSE as the subscriber will not be able to sign other certificates using the one issued by the CA.
In a self-signed certificate the property Subject Key Identifier and Authority Key Identifier have the same values while in a CA-signed
certificate the Authority Key Identifier value must be the same as the Subject Key Identifier value of the issuing CA certificate.
## Verify the certificates chain
In the certificates chain, from our certificate to the root CA certificate and any intermediate certificate, the
issuer of our certificate must match with the subject of the root CA or the intermediate CA, the sub CA in our example. The same is valid between the root CA certificate and its sub CA certificate, the issuer of the sub CA certificate must match with the subject of the root certificate. The chain can be verified using a single command
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl verify -CAfile ../ca/rootca.crt -untrusted ../ca/subca.crt mycertificate.crt
{% endhighlight %}
## Certificate Management
The private key and the certificate can be put together in a keystore. There are different types of keystores. One type that can be created with OpenSSL is the PKCS#12. One other keystore that is used often with Java can be created at the command line with keytool that is always available in any Java environment.
### PKCS#12 keystore
The private key and the certificate can be put into a PKCS#12 keystore. The public key is already in the certificate so it doesn't need to be included.  
1) Import the private key and the certificate in the pkcs#12 keystore
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey client.key -in client.cert -out client.p12
{% endhighlight %}
The output, client.p12, is a binary file.  
2) Extract the certificate from the pkcs#12 file. The output is a PEM format file encoded in Base64
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl pkcs12 -in mykeystore.p12 -nokeys -out mycertificate.pem
{% endhighlight %}
3) Transform the certificate from Base64 to text
{% highlight bash %}
$ openssl x509 -text -in mycertificate.pem > mycertificate.crt
{% endhighlight %}
