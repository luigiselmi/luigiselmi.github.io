I have been following the Copernicus programme for more than a year, trying also to refresh my knowledge about remote sensing. Copernicus provides open access to the images from a constellation of satellites that have been launched in orbit to monitor the atmosphere, oceans and land. Maybe today the only thing on which everyone agrees is that we are witnessing the impacts on our societies of disastrous events that are undeniably linked to climate change due to human activities. Citizens, communities, administrations, enterprises, insurance companies have to monitor and adapt their activities and infrastructures to the new scenarios and this is even more important in urban environments where such infrastructures and people are concentrated.

## Introduction
From the Copernicus website: “Copernicus is a EU programme aimed at developing European information services based on satellite Earth Observation and in-situ data”. The programme relies on a constellation of dedicated missions, the Sentinels, and other contributing missions. Watch this video for a short introduction to the programme.

## Satellites and Earth System Models
### Sentinel-1
Sentinel-1 comprises a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, operating on the microwave (MW) part of the spectrum (SAR, C1-band).
Instruments
Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-band)
### Sentinel-2
Sentinel-2 comprises a constellation of two Land-monitoring multispectral optical satellites (Sun-synchronous orbit, bands: VIS, NIR, SWIR), Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B (from Q1-Q2 2017). Each satellite provides global Earth coverage every 10 day, 5 days when operated together.
Instruments
MSI
### Sentinel-3
Sentinel-3 is a multi-instrument mission to measure sea surface topography, sea and land surface temperature and colour to support ocean forecasting systems, environmental monitoring and climate monitoring.
Instruments
Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR)
Sentinel Radar Altimeter (SRAL)
Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI)

## Satellites Main Parameters
The satellites are divided into two broad categories: optical and radar. Optical satellites rely on the solar radiation reflected by the Earth's surface in the visible (VIS) or infrared (IF) part of the spectrum. Radar satellites are active systems, usually operated in the microwave (MW) part of the spectrum to bypass the clouds that send radiation to a target area and collect the radiation reflected by it. All the radar satellites operated at the MW use the synthetic aperture antennas (SAR Synthetic Aperture Radar). The satellites are classified according to parameters such as

Orbit
Revisit time
Spectral bands (MW, VIS, IF)
Resolution
Coverage

The resolution depends on the spectral band and on the image processing (sampling frequency).
Resolution Classes

|Class|Resolution|
|-----|----------|
|VHR1 |Res < 1m  |
|VHR2 |1m < Res <= 4m|
|HR1  |4m < Res <= 10m|
|HR2  |10m < Res <= 30m|
|MR1  |30m < Res <= 100m|
|MR2  |100m < Res <= 300m|
|LR   |Res >= 300m|

## Core Datasets
The data collected by the satellites are processed at different levels for signal integration, synchronization, correction, geo-reference,  before being offered to the users.

## Product Levels
Products are shipped at different elaboration levels.

|Level|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|L1    |raw data   |
|L2    |removed optical errors, physical parameters, georeferenced |
|L3    |additional elaboration |
