I have been following the Copernicus programme for more than a year, trying also to refresh my knowledge about remote sensing. Copernicus provides open access to the images from a constellation of satellites that have been launched in orbit to monitor the atmosphere, oceans and land. The resolution in the optical band is 10 meters that is good enough in many uses cases such as change detection. I have still to see the details about all the satellites and sensors. Since I learned how to use machine learning algorithms to extract information from images such as convolutional neural networks (or CNN) I am looking forward to know how to use them with such images that have their own characteristics such as size, resolution, cloud coverage, revisit time and others that require a good understanding of remote sensing, distributed computing and machine learning in order to use this resource at its full potential. Maybe today the only thing on which everyone agrees is that we are witnessing the impacts on our societies of disastrous events that are undeniably linked to climate change due to human activities. Citizens, communities, administrations, enterprises, insurance companies have to monitor and adapt their activities and infrastructures to the new scenarios and this is even more important in urban environments where such infrastructures and people are concentrated.
